1. Trained a neural network to learn from the data which contains images of digit of shape 28x28.
2. Used Python libraries like Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-Learn for data preprocessing and data visualization.
3. Build a Multi-Layer Convolutional neural network for recognition of digit using Keras framework.
