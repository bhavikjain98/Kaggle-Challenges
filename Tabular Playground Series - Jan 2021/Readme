Kaggle competitions are incredibly fun and rewarding, but they can also be intimidating for people who are relatively new in their data science journey. In the past, we've launched many Playground competitions that are more approachable than our Featured competition, and thus more beginner-friendly.

In order to have a more consistent offering of these competitions for our community, we're trying a new experiment in 2021. We'll be launching a month-long tabular Playground competition on the 1st of every month, and continue the experiment as long as there's sufficient interest and participation.

The goal of these competitions is to provide a fun, but less challenging, tabular dataset. These competitions will be great for people looking for something in between the Titanic Getting Started competition and a Featured competition. If you're an established competitions master or grandmaster, these probably won't be much of a challenge for you. We encourage you to avoid saturating the leaderboard.

For this competition, you will be predicting a continuous target based on a number of feature columns given in the data. All of the feature columns, cont1 - cont14 are continuous.
