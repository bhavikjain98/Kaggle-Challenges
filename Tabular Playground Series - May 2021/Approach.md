1. Done Exploratory Data Analysis to find out more about the data and insights.
  a. The mean of the all the features are closer to zero.
  a. There is low variance across all the features.
  a. The median is mostly 0 except two columns
  a. Column names doesn't make much sense as all of columns are named by integer with prefix as feature.so from domain stand-point, cannot interpret much information from column       names.
  a. No missing values in the dataset
  a. All the columns are of type integer
2. Applied various Machine Learning Algorithms like CatBoost, XGBoost to find the better scores.
3. Applied H2O AutoML on the dataset.
